Saw this section on [Mukul's website](https://mukul-mehta.in/til/) and thought it made complete sense to have it here. 
A notes section of the website if you may, where I can keep tabs on what I've learnt and share it with people.

I've been trying my hand at a lot of new things lately, so I want to make notes of what I'm doing - so I don't end up blind coding - and actually improve my understanding of whichever domain I'm working on.
The next order of business would therefore be to write quick TILs for things I've learnt to use in the past week or two, which is the following:
- Hosting a website
- Setting up your custom domain email
- Using Claude Cowork for automation tasks
- Setting up Clawdbot for use as a personal assistant
- Using home servers
