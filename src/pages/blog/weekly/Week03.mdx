Very eventful week. I’ve been thinking a lot more about what my identity outside of work is. How do I spend my time? Who do I meet? What do I like? What do I do? 

I’ve always hated answering that last question with what I do for work. Everytime someone asks me that, I make it a point to answer with both what I do for work and otherwise. But I’d be lying if I said that’s not the first thing that comes to my mind when I get asked that question. 
This week, I’m making a conscious effort to build the kind of life I want to live. Can’t think of what I do outside of work if I spend all my energetic hours at or thinking about work. 

So I’ve been going out a lot more, meeting a lot more folks and exploring new things. This feels so much better than what I did over the past 3 months. 
Maybe it feels so because the pressure is off, but it’s a welcome change. I will try and keep this alive. I now want to optimize for agency and ownership over my time instead of just thinking about what’s good for my career. I don’t know how it will work out, but fortunately I can afford to experiment.
