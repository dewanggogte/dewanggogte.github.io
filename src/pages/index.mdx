<section class="bio">

I work with startups — usually on product, data, or whatever's blocking progress. I've spent time at American Express, Drip Capital, and a few early-stage companies where my job title was less important than getting things done.

I studied Biotechnology and AI at IIT Kharagpur, but most of what I know came from talking to people and doing new things. I want to try and do more of that.
{/* When I'm not working, I'm usually <a href="https://instagram.com/dewangraphy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking photos</a> — mostly a cinematic view into my surroundings — or making music.  */}

This site is meant to be a place to share my thoughts, experiences and ideas. And some <a href="https://instagram.com/dewangraphy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> photos</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/iwg7ch1br16aowx3t2sankj9a?si=9647eb99f68d48c5://open.spotify.com/user/dewanggogte" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> music</a>. 
It will eventually have more of all that. 

For now though, it's just this.
