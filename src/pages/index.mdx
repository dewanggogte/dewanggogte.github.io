<section class="bio">

I work with startups — usually on product, growth, or whatever's blocking progress that week. I've spent time at American Express, Drip Capital, and a few early-stage companies where my job title was less important than just getting things done.

I studied biotech and AI at IIT Kharagpur, but most of what I know came from building things, breaking them, and figuring out why.

When I'm not working, I'm usually <a href="https://instagram.com/dewangraphy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking photos</a> — mostly cinematic stuff with dramatic light — or making music. This site will eventually have more of that. For now, it's just me.
