# dewanggogte.github.io

This is the source code for my personal website at [dewanggogte.com](https://dewanggogte.com).

## About

I built this as a minimal personal site to share a bit about myself, my work, and how to get in touch. It's hosted on GitHub Pages with a custom domain.

## Tech Stack

The site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and uses MDX for content, keeping things lightweight and fast.

## Structure

- `src/pages/index.mdx` — Main page content
- `src/layouts/Base.astro` — HTML layout and global styles
- `public/` — Static assets like my resume PDF
